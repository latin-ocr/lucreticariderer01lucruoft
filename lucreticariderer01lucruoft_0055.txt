DE RERUM NATURA

LIBER PRIMUS

Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
alma Venus, caeli subter labentia signa
quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis
concelebras, per te quoniam genus omne animantum
concipitur visitque exortum lumina solis: 5
te, dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila caeli
adventumque tuum, tibi suavis daedala tellus
summittit flores, tibi rident aequora ponti
placatumque nitet diffuso lumine caelum.
nam simul ac species patefactast verna diei 10
et reserata viget genitabilis aura favoni,
aeriae primurn volucres te, diva, tuumque
significant initum perculsae corda tua vi.

15 inde ferae pecudes persultant pabula laeta

14 et rapidos tranant amnis: ita capta lepore 15

11 yenitabilis. genitalis has no authority, but it does not appear to be ‘typo-
graphi Veronensis peccatum’, as Ι found it in Vat. 1136 Othobon. 14 15:
Niccoli followed by all the Flor. mss. Camb. etc. has these verses in the right
order. 14 Wak. proposes fere which is indeed rather the ms. reading.

After 15 the v. Illecebrisque tuis omnis natura animantum is inserted in the
Juntine and in most subsequent editions, not however by Naugerius in Aldine 2,
as Lachmann incorrectly states. It has been generally assigned to Marullus, but
as 1 found it in the margin of Flor. xxxv 29, for reasons given above p. 8 Ι attribute
it to Angelo Politian. Victorius however inserts it among what profess to be solely
Pontanus' conjecturem though he has not written it in the same style, nor appa-
rently at the same time, as the rest : it is possible then that Fontanus or he may
have got it from Politian’s ms. Marullus in marg. Mon. for capta proposes
