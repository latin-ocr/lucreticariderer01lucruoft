20 INTRODUCTION

the last of his 1200 quarto pages there is not a single explanation of the
words or philosophy of his author for which a schoolboy would thank
him : so incurably inaccurate and illogical was his mind. Yet owing to
the boldness with which he asserted his pretensions he was thought even
by scholars to have done something great for his author: he received
complimentary letters from Heyne and Jacobs, ‘hominibus modestis
et ab omni iudicii subtilitate abhorrentibus', and more than thirty years
afterwards Forbiger in preparing his compilation for the use of the
general public took him for his supreme authority. Even later than that
so great a scholar as Ph. &Vagner often appeals to him in his notes to
Virgil. But though long in coming the avenger was to be.

Already in 1832 Madvig in a short academical program‚ afterwards
republished among his opuscula, exposed the futility of Wakefield’s
criticism and gave some intimations of the right course to pursue. Sti-
mulated by his example more than one scholar followed up the attack.
The most important contribution of this kind was made by Jacob
Bernays in an article printed in the Rhenish Museum of 1847. This
able paper would have produced a greater effect than it did, if it had
not been so soon superseded by Lachmann's more complete and systema—
tical work. This illustrious scholar great in so many departments of
philology, sacred, Classical and Teutonic, seems to have looked upon
Latin poetry as his peculiar province. Lucretius his greatest work was
the main occupatiori of the last five years of his life, from the autumn of
1845 to November 1850. Fortunately he had the full use for many
months of the two Leyden mss. His native sagacity, guided and sharp-
ened by long and varied experience‚ saw at a glance their relations to
each other and to the original from which they were derived, and made
clear the arbitr-ary way in which the common texts had been constructed.
His zeal warming as he advanced, one truth after another revealed itself
to him, so that at length he obtained by successive steps a clear insight
into the condition in which the poem left the hands of its author in the
most essential points. Like many other great scholars he seems to have
kept few or no common-place books. Resolved to master his subject he
perused the grammarians and poets and nearly the whole of the older
writers in order to illustrate Lucretius through them and them by
Lucretius, and the Latin language by all. He had an almost unequalled ·
power of grasping a subject in its widest extent and filling up the
minutest details, One mark of a great original critic, which eminently
belongs to Lachmann, is this: even when wrong, he puts into your
hands the best weapons for refuting himself, and by going astray makes
the right path easier for others to find. Another test is this, when his
influence extends far beyond his immediate author. Now hardly any
work of merit has appeared in Germany since Lachmann's Lucretius in
any branch of Latin literature without bearing on every page the impress
