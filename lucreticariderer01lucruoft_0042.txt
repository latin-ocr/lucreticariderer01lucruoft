26 INTRODUCTION

intervention for the special use of the copyist of this codex? Again I
would ask whether he looks upon the laborious and sagacious calcula-
tions‚ by which Lachmann demonstrated the number of pages in the lost
archetype and the number of verses in each page, as a mere plaything
thus to be trifled with 3 and not rather as a key to unlock many secrets
of criticism and not to be understood even without some slight effort of
mind. Ι beg to tell him that the number of lines in the archetype be-
tween 111 360 and 403 was not either 52 or 42, but 443 that is to say
42 verses of the poem÷ two headings: and that 111 360 did not com-
mence, nor 111 402 terminate a leaf 3 but that 111 360 was the fifth line
of page 108 of the archetype, and 111 402 was the fourth line from the
bottom of page 109. F urther study too will perhaps make him regret
that 116 has put the unfortunate paragraphs between Ι 503 and 634 to a
fresh torture, and permit him to see that in no part of the poem is the
argument or text in a sounder state—But even while revising the 2nd
ed. for the press I found in a recent program by Th. Bergk, with the
name of Ed. Heine on the title-page, a fresh attempt to magnify this
much vexed Victorian codex: in p. XIV it is said that it ‘solus iusto ordine
exhibet libro 1v locum antiquitus archetypi schedae paginis inversis per-
turbatum: nam post v. 298 Atque ea continuo sequuntur v. 323 Servet.
...347 Ac resilire, tum V. 299 Splemlida...322 Quae sita sunt, denique
V. 348 Quod contra. hoc igitur insigne est virtutis documentum, atque
possit aliquis inde colligere librum Poggianum ex archetypo descriptum
esse, antequam illae paginae inversae sunt' etc. Is it not strange that
so definite an assertion should be printed, when in truth this manuscript
has the verses in just the same inverted order, in which they are given
by the Leyden and all other known mss.2 Nay more the corrector
(Marullus without doubt) arranges the disordered lines, whether after
Politian or not, exactly as Candidus does in the J untine, who beyond
any question adopted his arrangement from this manuscript. And yet
the main purpose of the program spoken of is to prove Marullus not to
be the corrector of this Victorian codex, and to prove it from this very
passage 1] It will be seen that by the materials which Ι have collected
and just described Ι have in many important cases got nearer than has
been done before to the readings of Poggio⁷s ms. which was a worthy
rival of the Leyden two.

But Lachmann's long experience and disciplined acuteness have en-
abled him to go beyond existing mss. and to tell us much of the lost
archetype, as Ι call it after him, of all existing mss. N otes 1 will shew
that many difficulties are cleared up by this knowledge. This archetype
then, though it is not certain that even A was immediately taken from
it, was written in thin capitals, like the medicean of Virgil3 the words
were not separated, but in the middle of verses points were put at the
end of clauses. Ancient mss. as a rule keep with singular care to the
