28 INTRODUCTION

enough to conceive any one ms., A or B or Poggio's, passing over by
mistake one whole page. But it is in the highest degree unlikely that
different copies, A B and Poggio’s, neither of which as Lachmann admits
was copied from the other, should all pass over a single page of their ori-
gina13 or that this single page should be wholly illegible, while that
which preceded and the reverse page of the same leaf should be entirely
uninjured. It seems to me therefore much more natural to assume that
our archetype or one of its predecessors accidentally omitted an uncertain
number of verses3 01· rather that a whole leaf of the archetype had been
lost, as after VI 839. Lachmann’s system of pagination would then be
set right in this way: only books 1V and v have an index capitum pre-
fixed filling one page 3 for that of vl as I have said is crammed into the
lower part of the last page of v: before this index in v Lachmann has
shewn that the archetype had one blank page. Assume now that one
page was similarly left blank before the index of IV and all will be right:
the pages of the archetype would then be raised to 304. The indam capi-
tum prefixed to vl I accidentally omitted to notice in former editions, as
it had no bearing 011 the question of pages. The assumption here made
which is commended by Mr Polle, but blamed by Mr Susemihl in philo-
log. xxlx p. 427 foll, Ι still think probable. The latter asks what con-
ceivable reason there could have been for the two blank pages before V,
except to begin the new book with a new leaf, as was done with all the
rest. Why, 1 which had no index prefixed began on the second page of
a leaf 3 so didm, which had no such index 3 so did VI whose index is
crowded together in the manner spoken of. Other mss. such as the me-
dicean of Virgil, seem to have no preference for beginning a book on a
new leaf. Why the two pages were left for the index between lv and v
I do not knOW, any more than why a page was left vacant somewhere be-
tween 1 785 and 1068: it had something to do perhaps with calculations
about the parchment required. I was going to say more, but forbear to
enlarge on so fruitless a topic.

But we are able to advance even beyond the archetype: in many
parts of the poem there are manifest undoubted interpolations‚ which
must have been inserted by some reader who wished at one time to con-
firm what is said, at another to convict it of inconsistency and the like.
Generally, not always, these passages are repetitions 01 genuine passages 3
sometimes they consist of several, sometimes of a single verse: Ι 44-
49 and 111 806-818 are good and incontrovertible examples. But
enough is said of these throughout our notes. Lachmann however still
unsatisfied has not paused even here, but has gone up to the very times
of the poet. No careful reader will refuse to admit that he has proved
not a few passages, some of them among the finest in the poem, to have
been subsequent additions made by the author, which he did not live to
embody properly with the rest 01 1113 work. Lachmann has gone too far;
