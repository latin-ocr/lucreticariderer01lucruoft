et quaecumque in eo fiunt fierique necessest, 45
pleraque ressolui, quae restant percipe porro,

quandoquidem semel insignem conscendere currum
*-

ventorum, ex ira ut placentur, ut omina rursum

quae fuerint sint placato conversa furore:

cetera quae ficri in terris caeloque tuentur 50
mortales, pavidis cum pendent mentibu' saepe,

et faciunt animos humilis formidine divom

depressosque premunt ad terram propterea quod
ignorantia causarum conferre deorum

cogit ad imperium res et concedere regnum. 55
nam bene qui didicere deos securum agere aevom,

si tamen interea mirantur qua ratione

quaeque geri possint, praesertim rebus in illis 60
quae supera caput aetheriis cernuntur in oris,

rursus in antiquas referuntur religionis

et dominos acris adsciscunt, omnia posse

added by Flor. 31 Camb. Brix. Mar. 46 ressolui Goebel obs. Lucr. p. 18 for
dissolui: comp. v 773 Qua fieri quicquid posset ratione resolvi: a friend suggests
that 1v 500 dissolvere causam may support dissolui here: but see notes 2. fiunt,
fateare necessest Pleraque dissolui Lach. most unsuitably, as if only pleraque, not
omnia, were to be dissolved. fiunt possuntque, u. P. dissolui Bern. to which the
same objection applies. Lamb. seeing this difficulty, in ed. 2 and 3 gives fiunt
fientque, necesse Esse ea dissolui. 47—49 an exceedingly corrupt passage; yet
1 fancy that Ι have amended it without much violence: in 47 Ι have changed
nothing3 after it there is manifestly a hiatus of several verses, the general sense of
which I have attempted to give in my translation. The ms. reading of 48 and 49 is
as follows, Ventorum exirtant placentur omnia rursum Que suerint sint placato conversa
favore : with eoeirtant ior ea: ira ut, comp. 1v 820 virtuti for vir uti. omnia for omina is
an almost unfailing blunder of mss. furore is from Lamb. ed. 2 and 3, and Auratus
forfavore. So Sen. Octav. 800 and 806 mss. have furore and furor for favore and
favor. The older emendations in Ald. 1 Junt. Lamb. etc. are so devoid of all
probability that I will not cite them: Lamb. indeed believes the lines not to be
Lucretius’3 nor is Lachmann’s text much happier: institui conscendere currum
Ventosum et certant planyentia flamina rursum, Quae fuerint, siue, placato conversa
furore: then at 50 he begins a new paragraph, and 52 for Et faciunt gives Haec
faciunt, though Lactantius twice over has the ms. reading. Bern. supposes alacuna
both before and after 48 which he thus leaves Ventorum existant, placentur omnia
rursum: 52 Mar. Junt. Lamb. etc. for Et faciunt have Effieiunt. 56 57:90
91=1 153 154: here in the 6th book Lach. rejects them in the first, retains them in
the second place: to me it is manifest that in both places they come from the
annotator who thought they were in point and consequently jotted them down in
