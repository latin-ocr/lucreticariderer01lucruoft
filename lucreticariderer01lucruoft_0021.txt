TO NOTES I 5

Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei : nunc collegae: impressus quidem:
sed tamen perpense examinatus. Codri quoque grammatici Bononiensis:
cuius copia mihi per Bartholomeum Blanchinum virum eloquii excultis-
simi facta est : Marullique poetae industria mira castigatum non defuit
exemplar Severo Monaco Placentino graece latineque perdocto musarum
athleta non gravatim offerente'. He makes no mention at all of the man
to whom he was most indebted, Avancius : for his text is a reprint of the
first Aldine, with however not a few changes of words or phrases, often
for the better, often for the worse, either inserted in the text or pro-
posed in the notes, and derived it may be presumed in many cases from
one or other of the sources just mentioned. But strange to say when he
makes a change in the text, the lemma of his note nearly always con-
tains not this reading, but that of Avancius as if he had meant it to
stand: thus 1 9 116 rightly reads diffuso lumine 5 but his lemma has αἰψ’-
fuso numine with Avancius, which the latter however corrects at the
end of his Catullus: and he adds ‘sunt qui legunt lumine’. 15 for
capta he wrongly inserts in the text quodque, but his lemma has capta,
and his note rightly explains the construction and makes no mention of
quodque. 34 his text properly has Reiicia his lemma Refficit after
Avancius; 35 his text Wrongly gives suspirans, the lemma suspiciens 3
and so throughout the poem. This very singular circumstance Ι explain
in this way: he was living at Rome when his edition was printed and
seems to have sent the text and commentary separately 3 for the book-
seller prints at the end a long page of errors with this notice prefixed,
‘Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis bibliopola ad lectorem. contuli
Pii exemplar cum edito Lucretio: labeculasque pauculas notavi cet.'
Pius' edition was reprinted by Ascensius in 1514 with not a few
changes in the text, some of them taken from the notes.

The next edition must be ever memorable in the history of Lucre-
tius, that published by Philip Giunta ‘anno salutis. M.D.X11. mense
martio’. Whether this means 1513 new style I cannot tellj, but I
know that he dates a Gellius and a Romualdi vita as published in
January 1513, ‘Leone pont. max. christianam RP. moderante' and
‘Leonis X anno primo'. Now Leo X only became pope in March of
that year 3 so that here he must be speaking of 15143 and in Florence
at all events this mode of (lating seems to have been in common use.
The editor was Petrus Candidus who, great and important as the cor—
rections are which he has introduced, has yet used a copy of the first
Aldine upon which to make them, though he has never mentioned the
name of Avancius. It seems to have been the practice of those times
to take at least whatever was printed without acknowledgment ε thus
Giunta regularly made booty of Aldus, Aldus of Giunta in turn.
What is said in the present case is grounded on a close inspection of
the two volumes. Candidus, where he does not designedly leave him,
