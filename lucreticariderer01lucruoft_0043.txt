same number of lines in a page: ours had 26 lines in a page, excepting
only those which concluded a book. But remember there was a heading
or title at the beginning of each section5 and each of these headings oc-
cupied a line. Lachmann brings many proofs of this being the number.
When this ms. was copied, it was clearly much torn and mutilated. It
was stated above that four portions, omitted in their place by Β, come
together at the end, and that these each formed a leaf of the archetype
which had fallen out of its proper place. Each of these alone or with its
headings consists of 52 lines. Then turn to note 1 on 1v 299—347
(323-347 299—322) where this inversion is explained in the same way,
by the accident that is of a loose leaf being turned the wrong way: see
also note l to 1 1068—1075 and 1094—-1101, where the mutilation is
accounted for in the same manner. Thus we obtain six certain land-
marks in different parts of the poem. The archetype therefore consisted
of 300 pages, or admitting, as seems to be an undoubted fact, that a
whole leaf is lost between VI 839 and 840, of 302 3 of which the first was
not written upon, as well as one for some reason or other somewhere
between 1 785, which ends one of the loose leaves at the end of B, and
1068 which, as shewn in note 1, begins a fresh leaf. Page 190 which
followed the end of 1v was left blank. Ι may also note that pp. 137 and
191 contained an index of the heading-s of 1v and v respectively‚ while
the headings of vl are crowded into the lower part of p. 249, the upper
part of which contained the last 13 lines of the text of v: see Lach. p.
398: although the different titles come in their places in these books too,
as well as in the first three which have no such index prefixed. Having
made for myself a list of these pages after the rules stated in various
places by Lachmann, I have found it of great use 3 as the ends of lines
throughout the poem towards the bottom of the several right-hand pages
had been specially exposed to mutilation in the damaged archetype.
Verses also omitted in their proper places were apt in this as in other
mss. to be put afterwards at the bottom of pages. Besides the injuries
which it had received from accident or ill usage, our archetype must
have been carelessly enough written, though A and B prove that it re-
tained many valuable vestiges of great antiquity, especially in the spell-
ing 01 words, and though there may have been few stages between it
and the age of the author. There is one point, the nature of the hiatus
after IV 126, as to which it is not easy to accept Lachmann's theory.
That there is a hiatus there, is indisputable and the special questions
connected with it are fully discussed in note 1 to that passage. As the
accidental loss of a whole leaf would not suit his system of pages, he
boldly declares that twenty-five verses and one heading have perished,
that is one single page of our archetype. Now it is easy enough, as we
have seen, to explain the accidental loss of a leaf, by which every subse-
quent copy must necessarily want the contents of that leaf: it is easy
