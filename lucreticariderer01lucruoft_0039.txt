304, and doubtless for the same reasonS‚ because copied from the same
ms. from which B was taken. It usually goes by the name of the
Gottorpian fragment from the place where it once was. I have three
collations of it, one published by Henrichsen in 1846, another in the
handwriting of Nic. Heinsius, another in that of Isaac Vossius. F or—
merly it had a very high reputation: in truth it much resembles, but is
more carelessly written than B, and is seldom of much use, except once
or twice to confirm A against B. Strangely enough there are in the
Vienna library fragments of a precisely similar ms, containing large por-
tions of the later books, viz. 11 642 to 111 621 inclusive, omitting how-
ever in the proper place 11 757—806 exactly as B does3 then vl 743 to
the end3 then follow, precisely as in B, the four omitted portions given
above, proving this to be copied from the ms. from which Β was taken.
N aturally enough these Vienna fragments were assumed to belong to one
and the same ms. as the Gottorpian 3 but Dr Ed. Goebel, from whom I
have borrowed this description of them, seems to prove in the Rhenish
Mus. n. 3. XII p. 449 foll. that the two portions now bound together are
of different sizes and belonged to different mss. However that may be,
the former part seems to be the same ms. as the Gottorpian, and the
other if not the same, is precisely the same in internal character, and in
either case is of the same, that is of very little value. Probably there·
fore a more accurate collation would hardly repay the labour.

All other mss. known to exist were, as has been already said, copied
mediately or immediately from Poggio's lost ms. which must have re-
sembled A almost as closely as the Gottorpian resembles Β. The most
important are among the eight preserved at Florence in the Laurentian
library‚ numbered 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 of desk xxxv. 30 was written
by N 10010 Ν iccoli himself, who had Poggio's ms. so long in his possession:
this we are told in the learned Mehus⁷ preface to his life of Traversarius
p. L. As he studied so many of N iccoli's manuscript letters, he must
have known his writing better than anybody else. There are many cor-
rections in a much later hand, but Niccoli himself seems on the whole to
have copied Poggio's ms. faithfully‚ and not to have made many changes.
His ms. therefore, as will be seen in notes 1, is of great value in deciding
between A and B. It is unfortunate that Lachmann could make no use
of it: I collated it with some care in the summer of 1851: the old
Verona and. Venice editions have a text closely resembling Niccoli's.
31 is next in importance to 30, but of a widely different character, hav-
ing a text much more corrected than Niccoli's or even Ver. and Ven. It
is clearly written and in excellent preservation, and much resembles in
general character the manuscript in our public library which I had open
before me all the time I was composing notes 1, and which is as well
preserved and as distinctly written as the other. It excels the Cam-
bridge on the whole, though the latter has many good corrections not in
