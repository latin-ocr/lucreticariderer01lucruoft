have passed middle life when he perished in the river Cecina near Vol-
terra April the lOth 1500, he must have been a mere child when on
the capture of his native city he was brought to Italy, probably to
Ancona. He received his training however in Florence, and he found
a Maecenas in Lorenzo de' Medici. Though he never printed anything
on Lueretius, his manuscript emendations appear to have been well
known during his life, and a copy of the poet to have been found on him
at his death: ‘ex miseranda illa in mediis Cecinae undis Latinarum
musarum iactura cladeque insigni unus est Lucretius receptus' says Can*
didus in his preface; and his friend Petrus Crinitus in his de honesta
disciplina xv 4, published in 1504, but mostly written it would seem
before Marullus’ death, after well refuting an alteration of his which
shall presently be referred to, adds ‘quae ab eius quoque sectatoribus
recepta sunt pro verissimis'. This intense love of Lucretius he seems
only to have conceived in the latter years of his life. Candidus, whose
preface full of feeling shews that he greatly loved Marullus and deeply
deplored his untimely end, strives to make the most of what he did : he
says ‘Lucretianae adeo veneris per onmem aetatem studiosus fuit, ut
cet.' But this must be an exaggeration: the first edition of his poems,
published without a date, but not later than 1490, containing only two
books of epigrams, shews so far as I can see no trace of any acquaintance
with Lucretius. Catullus is chiefly imitated even in the elegiacs, and
next to him Tibullus and Horace. Six pages from the beginning there
is a poor poem of eight lines ‘de poetis Latnis⁷ [sic], in which he says
that Tibullus Maro Terence Horace Catullus, each in his kind, are
the only good Latin poets: Hos si quis inter caeteros ponet vaces,
Oneret quam honoret verius. The Roman editions of 1490 and 1493
Ι have not access to 3 but in December 1497, two years and a few months
before his death, he published at Florence a much enlarged edition. A
third and fourth book of epigrams are added: in these too I find no
trace of Lucretius. Then follow four books of hymni naturales. In
these, especially such as are written in heroics, the strain is ‘of a higher
mood', and we meet with frequent imitations of Lucretius, even in the
lyrics, as Opibusque late pollens tuis which recalls Ipsa suis pollens opz'r
bus. But in these heroics it is to be noticed that the rhythm is Virgi-
lian, not in any respect Lucretian even where he closely follows the
latter's language‚ as in the hymn to earth: Ante repentino caeli quam
territus haustu Vayiat aetheriam in lucem novus editus infans. Cum
proiectus humi ‘nudus iacet, indiqus, eaesors Anatilii, &firmusque pedam
infirmusque palati. Then imitating at once and contradicting Lucretius'
ut aecumst, Cui tantum in vita ‘restet cet. he goes on Atque uno non
tantum infelix, quod sua damna N on capit et quantum superat per-
ferre laborum. This the last poem published in his lifetime is full from
beginning to end of Lucretian phraseology. In this edition too he
