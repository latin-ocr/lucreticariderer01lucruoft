32 INTRODUCTION

and made the best approximation he could to what his author might have
written, always taking the most ancient form for which his authorities
supplied any testimony direct or indirect. Thus the question was not
foreclosed 3 nor were we left to vague genemlities, but a firm historical
groundwork was gained upon which future improvements might be built,
if better evidence hereafter offered itself. Lachmann then in this, as in
so many other departments of philology, seems at once to have produced
conviction in the minds of the majority of the most thoughtful scholars,
in Germany I mean 3 for in our own country most seem to scout the
question as unworthy of serious attention: a great mistake 3 for Latin
orthography is a most interesting and valuable study to those who care
to examine it, and touches in a thousand points the history grammar and
pronunciation of the language. Let me give two examples of the effect
at once produced by Lachmann. Otto Jahn in 1843 published his
elaborate edition of Persius in which he adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though he had so many excellent mss. to guide him
to a better course : in 1851, the year after Lachmann's work came out,
he published the text of his Juvenal and followed in it most minutely
the principles of Lachmann3 and fortunately he had a most excellent
authority in the codex Pithoeanus 3 so that the spelling is probably not
very far removed from the author⁷s own. In the years just preceding
Lachmann Halm published several orations of Cicero with elaborate
critical Latin notes: and yet, though his spelling was somewhat better
than that of J alm's Persius, it is still essentially ‘conventional' and arbi-
trary : in the years following Lachmann he published a series of school
editions of Cicero's orations with brief German notes, and now in these
the spelling was wholly modelled on the system pursued by Lachmann.
The same system too he has carried out in those volumes of the elaborate
edition of Cicero edited by him and Baiter, which came out after Lach-
mann’s Lucretius. Stimulated by the examples of Madvig Ritschl and
Lachmann the rising generation of German scholars has pursued the
critical study of Latin with eminent success 3 and nearly all of them fol-
low in orthography the guidance of Lachmann. This system then may
fairly I think be now regarded as the true ‘conventional' system 3 for
surely the Lachmanns and Ritschls of the nineteenth century have a
better right to dictate to us in the present day what shall be accepted as
‘conventional' than the Poggios and Vallas of the fifteenth. Since my
first edition came out, Madvig has published the last books of his text of
Livy, of which there exists but a single and very ancient 1115. z these he
has edited in a form differing from that of the other books, and has now
given his very weighty authority in favour of adhering to the spelling of
the oldest mss, with some reservations which I do not understand. And

now too in his new edition of the de finibus he has entirely abandoned
the orthography of the other.
