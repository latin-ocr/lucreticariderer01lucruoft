spelling therefore uncertain, such as the penult of superlatives and cer-
tain other adjectives, and words like lubet or libet, dissipat or dissupat,
quadrupes or quadripes and many others, Ι have of course submitted to
the guidance of our mss. which only once for instance have u in the su-
perl. and once manufesta, and twice offer arbita, not arbuta. Augustus,
having learnt it probably in boyhood from the all-accomplished dictator,
for whose apprehension nothing was either too little or too great and
who, Gellius tells ηε, first introduced the i for n in superlatives, invaria-
bly writes frequentissimus septimus vicensimas, as well as finitimus ma-
nibiae: comp. what Suetonius says of his use of simus for sumus, pro-
bably from a wish to be consistent. He would scarcely have thanked
Varius and Tucca for bringing him the Aeneid embellished with Wag-
ner's maxumus, septumns and the like, introduced so often in spite of his
mss. [Both forms are found in the same sentence lex colon. Genetivae
c. 66 (Ephem. Epigraph. vol. 111 p. 93) optima Zeqe optumo iura]
I have likewise followed AB in the adoption of e or o in vertere or
vortere and the like : e is naturally the more common, yet vorti vorsum
divorsi vortitur convortere vortere are all found: also in reading reddunda,
yiynundis dicundum cernundi faciundum aqundis cet. or the more usual
ayendum quaerendum cet. Do I then claim in all these doubtful cases
to reproduce the spelling of Lucretius or his first editor 2 Certainly not ;
but still in most of them Lucretius and his contemporaries undoubtedly
allowed themselves much latitude; and I have not intentionally permit-
ted anything to remain which might not have been found in one or other
ms. before the death of Virgil. By adhering tenaciously to the mss.
where not demonstrably wrong one gains a firm resting place from which
to make further advances, if better evidence offer itself. However that
may be, I cannot bring myself to accept the arbitrary and eclectic system
of a Wagner, much less the hideous barbarisms of a Wakefield ; nor on
the other hand, after feasting on the generous cereals of a Lachmann and
a Ritschl, can Ι stomach the ‘conventional' husks and acor-ns of the
Italians of the l5th century. At the same time it will be seen that my
spelling differs less from this system, than does that of Wagner in his
standard text of 1841, or even his Subsequent modification of that text
for common use which Prof. Conington has adopted in his Virgil.
