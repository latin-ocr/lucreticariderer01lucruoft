nec quod inane autem est ulli subsistere debet,
quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat„ 1080
haud igitur possunt tali ratione teneri
res in concilio medii cuppedine victae.
Praeterea quoniam non omnia corpora fingunt
in medium niti, sed terrarum, atque liquoris

et quasi terreno quae corpore contineantur, 1085
umorem ponti magnasque e montibus undas,

at contra tenuis exponunt aeris auras

et calidos simul a medio differrier ignis,

atque ideo totum circum tremere aethera signis

et solis flammam per caeli caerula pasci, 1090
quod calor a medio fugiens se ibi conligat omnis,

nec prorsum arboribus summos frondescere ramos

posse, nisi a terris paulatim cuique cibatum

1091 se ibi Wak. for sibi. 1094—1101 ε A has faithfully left a blank space
for these eight lost verses: they came at the beginning of p. 46 of the lost arche-
type ; the eight mutilated lines above having headed the page on the other side of the
leaf ; Lach. therefore most justly concludes that this part of the leaf in the original
of orur mss. was by some accident torn away. Both the old ms. collations of A and
B which Ι possess mention this lacuna: Heinsius says ‘in A octo versuum hiatus
erat relictus ἐ the less careful Vossius, though the manuscript was his own, merely

says ‘vide ms. in quo hiatus post haec verba ’. Think now of Havercamp, a Pro·
sessor in the University where A and B then were, never noting this fact, but

inserting the miserable makeshift verse of Mar. and J unt. Terra det: at supra circum ¹
teyere omnia eaelum stealing the critical note of the London bookseller’s edition,
and stating that this spurious verse was not in B, from which every reader must
infer it was in A. I formerly made the following verses to shew the general sense
of those which are lost: Dzffundat truncum ac ramos natura per omnis, Scilicet
incerto diversi errore vagantes Argumenta sibi prorsum pugnantia ιίὶηρῑιηε. Quae
tamen omnia sunt falsa ratione recepta. Nam quoniam docui spatium sine fine
modoque Immensumque patere in cunetas undique partis, Sic parili ratione ‘necessest

suppeditetur Infinita etiam vis undique materiai, Ne cet. Pontanus saw that the
passage was a fragment.
