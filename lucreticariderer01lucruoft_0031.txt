the field of conjecture, and for nearly three centuries his remained the
standard text. Lachmann says he did much less than Marullus. But
so far as there is truth in this, it is merely saying that the one lived
before the other: nine tenths of what Marullus effected, Lambinus could
have done currente calam03 but I doubt whether Marullus could have
accomplished one tenth of what Lambinus succeeded in doing. Lach-
mann accuses him of strange levity and rashness. But it must be re-
membered that in a short life he got through an amazing amount of
work in conformity with the wants of his age. Hc only gave two years
and a half to his brilliant edition of the whole of Cicero: and probably
did not spend many more months 011 1115 Lucretius than Lachmann spent
years. Nor was it possible in that age even for a Lambinus to appre-
hend the true relation of the mss. of Lucretius to one another. His
copious explanatory 31101 illustrative commentary however calls for un-
qualified eulogy‚ and has remained down to the present day the great
original storehouse, from which all have borrowed who have done
anything of value for the elucidation of their author. Scaliger says
‘Lambinus avoit fort peu de livres': if so he made good use of them,
as his reading is as vast as it is accurate, and its results are given in 3
style of unsurpassed clearness and beauty. His notes observe the mean
between too much and too little: he himself calls them brief, while his
thankless countrymen, thinking however more perhaps of his Horace
than his Lucretius, have made lambin and lambiner Classical terms to
express what is diffuse and tedicus. A second and much smaller edition
with only a few pages of notes, but with many variations from the first,
was published in 1565.

Scarcely could this first edition have issued from the press, when the
well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertus Gifanius of Buren began
with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and convert it
to his own purposes. His Lucretius was printed by Plantin of Antwerp
in 1566 35 stated at the end, though of two copies before me the title-
page of one has on it 1566, the other 1565, which is the date of his own
address to Sambucus, and of the two privilegia at the end, for the
March 1564 of the first must be old style, as it is later than the Febru-
ary 1565 οἱ the second. He brought nothing new to his task, except
the ms. notes of Marullus in the old Venice ed. fully spoken of above 3
for the emendations and readings of Antonius Goldingamus homo
Anglus, which he speaks of in his preface, and the veteres libri and the
like which occur throughout his book are mere blinds to conceal his
thefts from Lambinus. The way in which he contrives at once to bestow
empty praise on this scholar and yet to extenuate his merits and put him
35 3 commentator of Lucretius on the same level with other learned
men, Turnebus for instance, is a marvel of astuteness. In the preface to
his third ed. Lambinus states the truth with great terseness: ‘omnia
