PREFAOE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

THE present edition is divided into three volumes, the first con-
taining the text and critical notes, the second the commentary and
general index, the third the translation.

The text is practically the same as in the last edition: in one
place only (1 442) a new reading is printed, and that was only omitted
before through accident as was explained at the end of the index.
There are a few additions, not more than half-a-dozen, to the critical
notes 3 these have been inserted in square brackets. The translation
too has undergone no change.

In the commentary there are few alterations but considerable
additions amounting in all to more than twenty pages. These supple-
mentary notes and illustrations have been taken from an interleaved.
copy of the last edition which was found among Mr Munro's books after
his death in the spring of last year. Also on p. 333 of the commentary
will be found some extracts from letters addressed by him to Professor
Palmer of Trinity College, Dublin, discussing the reading of v 1010;
Professor Palmer was kind enough to send me these letters. As
the extracts deal with the criticism rather than the explanation of the
passage, they should have been inserted in the first volume 3 but by
an accident they were delayed until after that volume was printed.
Nothing has been inserted from any other source whatever. Here
too all that is new has been inclosed in square brackets. In the new
ex‘amples the references have been verified. To the index large
additions have been made by myself.

It remains to express my thanks to Dr Forbes, the relative and
executor of Mr Munro, for the kindly feeling which led him to entrust
me with the preparation of this edition, and also for the generous
consideration he has shown throughout.
