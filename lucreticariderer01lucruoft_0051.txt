TO NOTES I 35

and once praescribta: see notes 2 to VI 92: in such forms sound must
have at an early period prevailed 3 and b d 9 gave way to p t c before s
and t: lapsus for labsus is the same principle as rem (reos), remi (recsi)
written sometimes rec-aci, rectum from reyo ε to judge from the best mss,
labsus and the like became again much more common in the silver age.
Mommsen has recently published an admirable copy and exposition of
the res gestae of Augustus from the Ancyra monument. Augustus was
somewhat of a purist in spelling and cashierecl an officer for using in a
clispatch the vulgarism isse (not iace) instead of ipse. His system quite
bears out what has just been said : he always writes imperium and impe-
rator 3 he has immortalis, but inmissus3 impensa, while the heading of
the work, not written by him, but perhaps by Tiberius, has inpensa:
generally conleqa and conleqz‘um, but once colleyium and collaticius 3 exili-
um, but eoestinquere 3 on the other hand sexsiens as well as seaeiens, prov-
ing that a: and ms were identical: he writes appellaverunt 3 but adque
the only time he uses the word.

Another question involving a multitude of details is the use of -is or
-es in the accus. plur. of participles and adjectives and substantives
whose gen. plur. ends in ium, as well as of some other classes, doloris or
dolores, maioris or maiores : here too Wagner involves himself in inex-
tricable perplexities by his eclectio system, when his mss. were admirable
guides, had he chosen to follow them. The mss of Lucretius are no less
admirable and probably represent very fairly the author's own usage:
they offer -is five times out of six 3 and -es is somewhat more common in
substantives in very general use, as iynes vires aures. Inscriptions quite
bear out our mss. 3 and the sole relic of Latin yet disinterred from Her-
culaneum contains this V. Utraque sollemnis iterum revocaverat orbes.
Pertz recently printed in the Berlin transactions the few remaining
leaves of a ms. of Virgil, which 116 assigns to the age of Augustus and
which may really be of the second or third century: we there find the
acc. plur. of adjectives and participles ending 18 times in -is, 3 times in
—es pares felices amantes 3 of substantives we find sonoris, but 4 times
vires, and artes messes crates classes aves, quite confirming the testimony
of our A and B. Varro de ling. Lat. vm 66 writes item quod in patrico
casu hoc yenus dispariliter dicatur civitatum parentum et civitatium pa-
rentium: in accusandi lios montes fontes et lios montis fontis3 and in
Lucr. 11 587 we find potestates, v 1239 potestatis: then ib. 67 he says
quid potest similius esse quam gens mens dens? quom horum casus patri-
cus et accusativus in multitudine sint disparilis3 ‘nam a primo fit gen-
tium et gentis, utrobique ut sit i3 ab secundo mentium et mentes, ut ire.
priore solo sit i3 ab tertio dentum et dentes, ut in neutro sit i 3 well our
mss. six times have the acc. yemis, never yentes 3 dentes four times,
never dentis3 mentes five times, once only, 11 620, mentis. As for the
nomin. plur. of such words, Varro 1. 1. 66 says sine reprehensione vulqo alii
