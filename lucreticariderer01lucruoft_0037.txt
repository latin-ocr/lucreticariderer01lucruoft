TO NOTES Ι 21

of his example. When he is better known in England, the same result
will follow here. Though his Latin style is eminently clear lively and
appropriate, yet from his aim never to throw away words, as well as
from a mental peculiarity of his, that he only cared to be understood by
those whom he thought worthy to understand him, he is often obscure
and oracular on a first reading. Had his commentary been twice the
length it is, it would have been easier to master. But when once fully
apprehended his words are not soon forgotten. His love for merit of all
kinds incites in him a zeal to do justice to all the old scholar-s who have
done anything for his author ; while his scorn and hatred of boastful
ignorance and ignoble sloth compe] him to denounce those whom he con-
victs of these offences. In one instance, that of Forbigcr, this sternness
passes into ferocity: most of his errors that scholar could hardly avoid
in the circumstances in which he was placed.

Hermann warns us, when we disagree with Lachmann, to think
twice lest we, not he, be in fault. His defects however must not be
passed over. While the most essential part of his work, the collation
of the two Leyden mss, has been performed with admirable skill and
industry, he has not been so happy in the use of secondary evidence, that
>of the Italian mss. and the older editions. Much he has taken on trust
on insufficient evidence, and much that he had before him he has not
always accurately used. Some proofs of this have been given, more will
be seen below. But a still more serious defect must be told: he meant
his book to be a critical revision of the text, and left to others the task
of explaining and illustrating the meaning. So far good: but as the
text of an author in the condition of that of Lucretius cannot be always
rightly constructed without a sufficient knowledge of his system and
its literature, he has not unfrequently strangely blundered and grossly
corrupted the poet's words: for examples of this see 1 599-634 11 522
—529 1010 foll. V 513—516. His consummate knowledge of the Latin
language as well as of the manner of Lucretius in particular enables him
often to amend his author with great success As he wishes too to pro—
duce, where it is possible, an intelligible text, many of his corrections he
must himself have looked upon as only provisional. Yet his greatest
admirers must concede that he has not Madvig's ‘curiosa felicitas' in
emendation. He has however achieved a work which will be a land-
mark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied,
a work, perfidiae quod post nulla arque& actas.

Jacob Bernays in 1852 edited a text of Lucretius for the Teubner
series. There can be little doubt that carried away by the strength of
his admiration for Lachmann he has followed him too faithfully 3 yet he
not unfreouently differs from him. NVhere he recalls the old reading he
is generally right 3 where he deserts him for a conjecture of his own, he
is often very successful. Had he prepared a more elaborate edition, as
