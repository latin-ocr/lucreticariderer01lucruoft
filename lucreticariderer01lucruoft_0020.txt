4 INTRODUCTION

of little, others of greater importance 3 for example 1v 125—190 are
wanting in the Verona, but not in the Venice. The reason why I
dwell on this fact will appear presently.

In December 1500 Aldus published his first edition of our poem, the
first systematic endeavour to make it intelligible throughout. The editor
was Hieronymus Avancius of Verona, who dates his dedication ‘Kalen-
dis Martii. M.1D', old style Ι presume, and really therefore 1500: an
interval of twenty-two months between the two dates would not be easy
to understand. Avancius is known by other works also, especially the
Aldine edition of Catullus. A slight inspection will shew that he took
either the Verona or the Venice edition, upon which to form his text3 a
more careful examination will prove that it must have been the latter.
My critical notes will furnish many other instances 3 let me here only
mention that in 111 994 he and Ven. have torpedine for cuppedine, while
Ver. reads tmpicline 3 1011 116 takes from Ven. its remarkable reading
aymus, which Lachmann adopts and wrongly assigns to Marullus: Ver.
follows the Leyden and all other known mss. in reading eyestas3 1015 116
and Ven. have the absurd reading numela for mella, where Ver. has the
equally unmeaning tiela. Ven. therefore is the ‘ante impressus ' spoken
of by Aldus. Avancius' preface shews that for his day he was a good
and well-read Latin scholar, and had studied Priscian Nonius and Ma-
crobius for the illustration of his author. Aldus in his prefatory letter
to Albertus Pius confirms this, and says that he knew Lucretius by
heart, ‘ut digitos unguesque suos'. Avancius in his preface asser-ts
much the same 3 and the few critical remarks he there inserts shew that
this was true at least to a certain extent. At the same time he admits
with a seeming candour that owing to the immense difficulty of the
work he has left much for others to do. Much indeed he has left un·
done3 and it would have been a herculean task for one man fully to cor-
rect the desperately corrupt Venice edition, especially in those days
when there were but few extraneous aids and the art of systematic criti-
cism was still in its infancy, two generations having yet to elapse, before
it reached its full growth in the hands of the illustrious school of French
critics. What he lias done however is very great and entitles him to
high praise‚ if it is indeed his own. But this shall be considered pre-
sently. The next edition is that of the well-known scholar Ioannes Bap-
tista Pius, published 1511 ‘kaL Maii' in his native Bologna. Lucretius' “
text is embedded in an enormous com mentary which displays amid much
cumbrous learning no slight acquaintance with the Latin poets, several
of which he edited before and after his Lucretius. He thus describes
what he has done: ‘contulimus non sine aerumnis vigiliisque diutinis
codicem veneti Hermolai: et Pomponi romani: codicemque non omnino
malum: qui servatur Mantuae in bibliotheca quadam suburbana: qui
fuit viri non indocti gentis clarissimae Strotiorum. non defuit Philippi
