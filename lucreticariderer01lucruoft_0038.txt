22 INTRODUCTION

he appears to have once had thoughts of doing, there is no doubt that
Lucretius would have owed him much. The impulse given by Lachmann
to the study of our poet has called forth numerous papers either inserted
in the German philological reviews or publishecl by themselves. Some
are of more, some of less importance: my notes will shew where I have
been indebted to them. One English publication of eminent merit, as
it criticises not the text of the poem, but its matter and poetical
beauties, shall be mentioned elsewhere.

To return now to the manuscripts whose history was sketched above.
Though I examined the two at Leyden for some days so long ago as
the autumn of 1849, what will now be said of them is borrowed from
Lachmann who had them in his hands for six months and during that
time applied the whole force of his practised and penetrating intellect to
unravelling all their difficulties and obscurities. Both, as already men-
tioned, belonged to the magnificent collection of Isaac Vossius. The
older and better of the two is of the ninth century written in a clear and
beautiful hand: I call it A. It has been corrected by two scribes at the
time that the ms. was written, as Lachmann tells us One of these is of
great importance ; in most essentia] points he agrees minutely with the
ms. of N iccoli, the oldest of the Italian mss. 3 and doubtless therefore
gives the reading of the archetype. It will be seen in notes 1 how often
Ι make the united testimony of A and Niccoli to outweigh all the rest.
The other Leyden mS. which I call B is of nearly equa] importance: it
is of quarto size closely written in double columns, apparently in the
tenth century. Itis probable that it and the ms. next to be mentioned
were copied from some copy of the archetype, not like A from the arche-
type itself. Four portions of the poem are omitted in their place, but
come together at the end in this order, 11 757—806 v 928—-979 Ι 734
-785 11 253-304, Lachmann has demonstrated that these sections
formed each an entire leaf of the lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 are the
numbers of these leaves. It is manifest then that after A was copied,
these leaves of the archetype had fallen out of their places and been put
together without order at the end, before B, or the original of B, was
copied from it. More will be said on this point presently. B has had
several correctors, but all of the 15th century 3 one a very brilliant critic

for his age, to whom are due many of the finest emendations in the poem, “

as will be seen in notes l. This ms. was once in the great monastery of
St Bertin near St Omer. Turnebus collated it in Paris and his colla-
tion as we saw was used with much effect by Lambinus: it afterwards
came into the possession of Gerard John Vossius, Isaac's father. A
large fragment of another ms. closely resembling B in everything double
columns and all, except that it is said to be a small folio, not quarto in
shape, is now at Copenhagen: it contains book 1 and 11 down to 456,
omitting however the same sections as B, viz. 1 734-785 and 11 253—
