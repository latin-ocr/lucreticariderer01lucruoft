PREFAOE TO THE THIRD ED1T10N

ALTHOUGH in outward shape this third edition exaotly resembles the
second, it will prove Ι trust in essential points to be more in advance
of the second, than the second was of the first edition. Partly for
other obvious reasons, and partly because the second impression was
larger than the first and has now been exhausted for nearly a year, the
interval given me for reflexion has been much longer3 and as 13116
author is now so familiar to me, Ι have been able to bring all my
reading to bear upon the improvement of the text and the commentary.
The critical notes are Ι believe improved in many important points,
though their bulk of course has not been increased: compression was
needed here rather than expansion. The explanatory notes however have
been enlarged by the substance of at least fifty pages, chiefly through a
somewhat closer printing. Nor does this at all represent the real
amount of change, as many of the longer notes have been entirely
rewritten and much that was superfluous or erroneous has been cut
out. Many thousand fresh illustrations have been added.

For more precise conceptions on some points of the poet's philo-
sophy, especially the motion of his atoms, I have been greatly indebted
to the works of Professor Olerk Maxwell and Professor Tyndall, and 130
a thorough and excellent article in the 481311 volume of the North
British Review on ‘the atomio theory of Lucretius’: of Martha’s

brilliant work Ι have spoken elsewhere. For the general criticism
