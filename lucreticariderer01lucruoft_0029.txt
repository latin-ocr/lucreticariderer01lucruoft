the appearance of being earlier and more rudimentary than those of the
other: he not unfrequently too sees that something is wanting and says
‘fragmentum ’, where the latter supplies a whole verse with more or less
success. The scholar therefore completed what the master commenced 3
and the emendation of Lucretius links their names together not less
honourably than does the verse we quoted from AriostO. Upon the whole
this fresh information has greatly raised my estimate of both, especially
of Marullus. His industry is at least as conspicuous as his sagacity: he
has evidently carefully collated manuscripts and editions and gathered
materials from all accessible sources. Throughout the poem the many
verses omitted in the Munich manuscript are supplied with unfailing
diligence. He evidently was acquainted with several of the existing
Florentine manuscripts 3 among others that of Niccoli I believe, as well
as that of his enemy Politian, and Flor. 31 whose readings Lachmann
so strangely assigns to the notary Antonius Marii. Upon the whole he
must be placed as an amender of Lucretius immediately after Lambinus
ancl Lachmann, if not indeed in the same front rank, when we consider
the circumstances of his age and the imperfectiori of his materialsj and
Pontanus perhaps may rank after him. Lambinus, as well as Avancius
and Naugerius editor of the second Aldine, must have had access to
some copy of Pontanus' corrections.

What Ι· said of Marullus in my first edition with much more imper-
fect materials from which to draw conclusions, I find now confirmed in
essential points. There were in circulation different copies of Marullus'
emendations, Gifanius had access to one of these : see notes 1 to 1 274
lv 1005, as well as 11 16 125 465 111 994 v 201 1151 vl 25: what Ι 111-
ferred from his own poenis is borne out by 11 719 and 749 and some
other passages: the assertion of Crinitus quoted above that Marullus had
corrupted VI 651 652 is fully confirmed here: Marullus for the correct
multesima most unskilfully proposes multa extima 3 and for tota reads
sit: the latter Candidus adopts. In other cases his more mature judg-
ment as seen in the Munich manuscript doubtless differed from his earlier
notions. A man who studied Lucretius so long and earnestly cannot
fail to have often changed his mind on further reflexion and with new
sources of information. Candidus does not by any means follow Ponta-
nus or Marullus in his orthography: that is formed as I proved in my
first edition mainly on Avancius. In many cases they might have taught
him better 3 to avoid for instance such embellishments as his amneis,
virenteis. He rightly however avoids such barbarisms as the lcymhres
and sylva of Marullus. From succus littus arctus and the like, which
the latter carefully introduces, we may infer that he and Pontanus had
some share in bringing such corruptions into common use. The careful
collation which I have given in this edition of the emendations of
Pontanus and Marullus will prove their importance, and shew how rash
