114 II

corpora prima quod in summis fluitare videmus
rebus et interdum nasci subitoque perire.
quin etiam refert nostris in versibus ipsis
cum quibus et quali sint ordine quaeque locata.
si non omnia sunt, at multo maxima pars est 1017
consimilis 3 verum positura discrepitant res,
sic ipsis in rebus item iam materiai
concursus motus ordo positura figurae 1021
cum permutantur, mutari res quoque debent.
Nunc animum nobis adhibe veram ad rationem.
nam tibi vementer nova res molitur ad auris
accedere et nova se species ostendere rerum. 1025
sed neque tam facilis res ulla est quin ea primum
difficilis magis ad credendum constet, itemque
‚nil adeo magnum neque tam mirabile quicquam,
quod non paulatim minuant mirarier omnes.
suspicito caeli clarum purumque colorem, 1030

relative: Lach. for summis unskiliully reads cunctis, and supposes 1013 to com-

mence a new paragraph wholly unconnected with what precedes: he encloses in
[ ] 1013-1104. The truth is 1013—1022 are closely united with what precedes
if rightly understood. Mar. Junt. Lamb. ed. 1, vulg. have parum for penes in 1010.
Lamb. ed. 3 has a long note shewing that his conception of the passage is no less
confused than Lachmann's: the small word qaod has given rise to these strange
misapprehensions. 1015 1016=1 820 821 with the exception of Siynificant for
Comtituzmt: 1020=726 and v 438: Lach. has rightly seen that they are here
quite out of place: in the first book they are properly said of the atoms, but
here they interrupt the sense: 1020 the interpolator has transferred hither without
taking the trouble of changing vias and plagas to viae and plagae, which was
first done by Pont. and Mar. 1017 sunt Lach. for sint: he compares 458.

1023 adhibe veram B corr. Ver. Ven. Mar. for adhibueram. 1024 vementer
Avanc. and Lach. rightly for vehementes: so vemens which occurs several times: in
fact those were the only forms known to Lucr. and all writers of the best ages: see
Lach. 1025 Accedere all mss. and old eds. z this old form I have retained here
and v 609 where A has Accedere, Nice. Accendere: see Vahlen’s Varron. sat. Menipp.

p. 95, and his Ennian. trag. rel. 114 and 281, where the best mss, of Ennius and ᾖ

Varro retain the same form accedo: it appears from Ribbeck that the mss. of Virgil
preserve in many similar words e for i, but his judgment in adopting them seems
often at fault: ap. Ribbeck trag. Lat. p. ix Fleckeisen gives examples from Plautum
Livy ΧΗ 10 12 mss. have accedere: 111 239 I retain rece'pz't of mss, peremo interemo
neyleyo irztelleyo were the only forms admitted in the best ages, as the concurrent
testimony of an good mSS. proves. 1029 minuant mirarier. mittant mirarier
Lach. which I adopted in the small ed. 1030 Suspicite Bern. for Principio.
Percipito Lach. which can hardly be right : indeed Principio is so appropriate that
I incline to think a verse is lost, such as this Caius, uti memoro, permulta exempla
