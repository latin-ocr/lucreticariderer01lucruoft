2 INTRODUCTION

first half of the twelfth century had taken the line from the poem itself 3
or had horrowed it from Priscian inst. IV 27 who cites it with nasci
instead 01 919111, the editor of the bibliotheca having thought fit tacitly
to substitute qigmi from Lucretius. The latter is proved to be the fact
by ΜΓ Julius Jessen in the philologus, vol. 30 pp. 236-238: he quotes
what follows fron] Barthius' very learned note on Stats silv. 11 7 76:
‘ nec vero cadentibus aut collapsis iam rebus Romanis auctoritatem suam
amisit Lucretius noster, ut videre potes apud Magnentium Rhabanum
praefatione Laudum Daedalarum Crucis, Gulielmum Hirsaugiensem in
Institutionibus Philosophicis et Astrologicis‚ Honorium Augustodunen-
sem in Historia Mundi, Ven. Bedam Libro de Metris'. Referring to
the only printed edition of this work of William of Hirschau, who lived
from 1026 to 1091, he shews that Honorius copied from him the passage
in question, and that Wssliam cites it thus τ ιΕ1111150115111 credas sensile
nasci ', getting it clearly then from Priscian. Hrabanus Maurus and
Beda seem just as little to have known Lucretius at first hand. [Hermes
vol. 8 p. 332, it is said that in Brit. Mus. 1115. 377 (13th century) 01
Daniel de Merlai's Philosophia, in p. 90 a, Lucretius is quoted]

In Italy he was even more completely unknown. A catalogue which
Muratori antiq. 111 p. 820 assigns to the tenth century, proves that the
famous library of Bobbio contained at that time librum. Lucretii Ι 3 but
before the fifteenth 110 Italian poet or writer shews any knowledge 01
him whatever. In the year 1414 the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini went
as apostolic secret-ary to the council of Constance and remained on this
side the Alps in different countries, Switzerland Germany F rance and
England, until 1420, with one short interval passed in Milan and
Mantua. During these years he procured from various monasteries
many most important Latin works hitherto totally unknown in Italy:
see Mehus' preface to his life 01 Ambrosius Traversarius p. xxxiii foll.
Among these was a manuscript of Lucretius, obtained apparently from
some German monastery either by him or his companion Bartholomew
of Montepulciano, about 1417 as his letters seem to indicate, and trans-
mitted the same year to his intimate friend the Florentine Nicolo Nic-
coli, a most zealous scholar and patron 01 the revived classical studies.
This manuscript, which Poggio wrongly supposed to be only a part of the

poem, has itself disappeared‚ but was the parent of every copy written ἱ

during the 15th century, that is to say of every one now extant with the
exception of those specified above : it must have very closely resembled
the Leyden folio. ‘ Et te, Lucreti, longo post tempore tandem Civibus
et patriae reddit habere suae' says Landinus in his poem in praise 01
Poggio. Niccoli having such a treasure in his hands was in no hurry to
part with it. We find Poggio writing to him in December 1429 to
remind him that he had kept his Lucretius twelve years. A few days
later it is ‘you have had Lucretius now for fourteen years 3 I want to read
