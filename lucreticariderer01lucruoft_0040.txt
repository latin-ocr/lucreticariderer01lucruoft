the other. These two therefore I have used as good examples of cor-
rected codices, From whom come the many excellent emendations con-
tained in these mss. is quite unknown. Lachmann used a not very
complete collation of Flor. 31, and to it he attributes the corrections
which it has for the most part in common with the Cambridge and
doubtless some other mss. Having been told too by H. Keil from whom -
he got the collation that it was written by Antonius Marii filius, he fills
his commentary from one end to the other with the name of this worthy
Florentine notary. I can only say that Ι compared it with ten or more
voluminous mss. written in magnificent style and signed by this man
between 1420 and 1451 all closely resembling each other3 and neither
in general appearance nor in the form of particular letters nor in their
abbreviations have they any resemblance to the ms. of Lucretius. This
soribe's name therefore Ι have excluded from my notes. Of the other
Laurentian mss. 29 is to be noticed for the marginal annotations of
Angelo Politian spoken of above and often referred to in notes 1 : it twice
over has this note ‘liber conventus Sancti Marci de Florentia ordinis
Praedicatorum habitus a publicis sectoribus pro libris quos sibi ab eodem
conventu commodatos Angelus Politianus amisit seu qui in morte Angeli
Politiani amissi sunt'. 32 has some learned marginal remarks on the
first book from which Ι have derived some facts about Marullus. The
six mss. of the Vatican I collated as long ago as the autumn of 1849, but
not with much care or skill ; yet it will be seen from notes 1 that they
have been of considerable service to me: their marks are as follows, 3275
and 3276 Vatic. 640 Urbin. 1136 and 1954 Othobon. and 1706 Regin,
at the bottom of the first page of which are the words ‘Nicolai Heinsii'.
As further helps I have had Gifanius⁷ ed. of 1595 with ms. notes by
Nic. Heinsius which I bought from H. G. Bohn many years ago: it will
be seen that Ι have derived from it some valuable emendations not in
Heinsius' adversaria nor elsewhere so far as I know, It has also a com-
plete collation of A all through, of Β 111 the first four books, and of the
Gottorpian fragment. It contains too a complete collation of the codex
Modii, which Heinsius denotes by s: he says of it ‘variantes lectiones
excerptae sunt ex libello edito Paris. an. 1565 quem Fr. Modius cum ms,
suo contulit, ut ipse testatur fine lib. 1 inquiens : Collatus cum ms. meo

26 Juniz' 1579 Coloniae': it was lent to Heinsius by Liraeus 3 Liraeus ’

had it from Gruter, Gruter from N ansius, Nansius from Modius himself.
Heinsius says ‘ codex Modii non est idem cum Β Vossiano, nam pag. 8
[1 227] ubi ex Modiano notatum ad lumina, Vossianus in'. Heinsius
speaks I presume of the small ‘And ed. of Lambinus, as the one which
Modius used: it has like others in lumina: if then Modius' codex is B,
either he or Heinsius has made a gross mistake. I have noticed several
other instances, where s is made to differ from 133 but in these cases
Lambinus⁷ 2nd ed. has the reading which Heinsius gives to 3, so that
