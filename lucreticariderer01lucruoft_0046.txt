30 INTRODUCTION

poet, inserted on the same principle as the longer sections discussed
above: these too the first editor, faithfully preserving everything in his
copy, but not caring always to find the right place for what the author
left ambiguous has inserted out of their order. Add to these v 437-
442 which the context could dispense with : these vss are found out of
place in Macrobius as in our mss. This increases the probability that
they were out of their proper order from the first, two apparently inde-
pendent authorities Macrobius and our archetype quoting them in the
same way. Perhaps these single vsS. might be added to the list, 1v 202,
205, VI 957, 1225, 1237, 1270 as they might all be dispensed with.
Look too at 1v 129—142, so strangely disordered in the mss: 133—135
may be all marginal additions by the author afterwards Wrongly placed
by the editor. The ms. arrangement of IV 299—348 has been already
accounted for. If all these passages are subtracted, there will then be
left a not very unusual number of single verses transposed by the ordi-
nary negligence of copyists. The numbers occasionally given on the left
hand of the page denote of course the order of the lines in mss. which Lach-
mann follows in his edition: where spurious vss. of the mss. are omitted
from the text, he still allows them to count. For obvious reasons I
have followed him in this, as he will be the future standard of compari-
son, and there is great advantage in a uniform numbering of the verses.

Since many special questions of orthography are noticed as they
occur in the notes, I should have thought it unnecessary to say more in
this place than that in essential points I follow Lachmann, if it were not
for the apparent unwillingness of scholars in this country to accept even
the smallest change in what they look upon as the usual or conventional
rules of spelling. The notion of any uniform conventional spelling is
quite a chimera: I never find two English editors following any uniform
system, nay the same editor wili often differ in different parts of the
same book. But whence comes this ‘conventional ' system, so far as it
does exist? from the meritorious and considering their position most
successful endeavours of the Italian scholars in the fifteenth century to
get rid of the frightful mass of barbarisms which the four or five pre-
ceding centuries had accumulated. They sought indeed to introduce
rigorous uniformity in cases where variety was the rule of the ancients 3
and though these cases embraced oniy a few general heads, they yet
comprised a great multiplicity of particular instances, because involving
the terminations of cases, the assimilation of prepositions in compound
verbs and the like. But where there was only one right course, they
generally chose it 3 yet from the utter confusion into which the use of the
aspirate had fallen, their own language having entirely lost it in sound,
but at this time retained it in spelling 5 from the almost complete iden-
tity both in sound and writing of c and t before i, and the like, they
never could tell whether humor or umor, humerus 01· umerus, spatium or
