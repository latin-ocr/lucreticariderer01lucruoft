36 INTRODUCTION

dicunt in sinqulari hac ovi et avi, cdii hac ove et ave, in multitudinis liae
puppis restis et liae puppes restes: the fragment of Virgil just cited has
the nomin. plur. putris and messis, though we saw it had messes in the
accus: in accordance then with these high authorities the mss. of Lucr.
not unfrequently retain this nomin. in -is, which it would be monstrous
to extirpate: I have always therefore kept it. In precise conformity
with Lucr. Augustus has in the accus. ayencis and labentes, finis and
fines, consules and once consulis: once too the nomin. pluris. On the
other hand he always uses the accus. yeme& departing in this word from
the rule of Varro and Lucr. We see from the corpus inscr. that -eis -i8
-es were all in use: it is probable that Lucr. occasionally employed the
termination -eis‚ intermediate in sound between -es and -is ; but, if so,
his manuscripts have left few or no traces, and it would be most perverse
to follow Avancius Wakefield and others in thrusting it into his verses
in season and out of season: v 1280 Β has mortaleis, perhaps from
Lucr. 2 Augustus more than once has this -eis in the abl. plur.‚ quadri-
9eis, emeriteis 3 and the inscription in his honour still existing on the
arch of Rimini erected in 727, midway therefore in time between his
res gestae and Lucr., has celeberrimas² vicis, redcliteis. A and B have
however not a few indications expressed or implied of the ending —eiz see
note 2 to 111 97 oculei : these have of course been carefully preserved.
On another question, comprehending a multitude of particular in-
stances, I have followed Lachmann and our mss, which here too are on
the whole excellent guides: I speak of the vowel or consonant u followed
by another u. The old Latins appear to have been unable to pronounce
uu 3 and therefore the ancient o long kept its place after u 3 or for qu c
or q was used ; quom qum or cum, never quum 3 {inquom linqunt or Zin-
cunt 3 scquontur‚ seqzmtar or seczmtur3 equos (nom.) equs or ecu83 volqus
dii-os divom aei-om and so on. They appear to have begun soonest to
tolerate uu in terminations, when both were vowels‚ suus tuus and the
like. Now the mss. of Lucretius have retained in very many instances
divom volnus volyo vivont cet. 3 equos (nom.) and ecus, ecum, aecum; ‘re-
linquont relinqunt or relincunt oftener than relinquunt, so sequontur
secuntur secutus locuntur locutus; but with Lachmann I retain the uu,
when the mss. offer it, in order not to get lost on a sea of conjectural

uncertainty like Wagner and some others, who not only desert 11133. but <

in many cases intrude a spelling older than the age of their author: thus
Augustus has rivus ‘rivum annuum (not once -uo or -vo) ; why not then
Virgil, or at least Varius and Tucca? The mss. of Lucretius are also
very pertinacious in retaining the genuine old forms ‘reicit eicit or eiecit
cet. and never offering reiicit eiicic and the like: Grai Grais, not Graii
Graiis. But further details on the most interesting points of the ancient
orthography will be found in various parts of my notes. Again in those
many cases where the sound was intermediate between u and i and the
