of my author Ι owe much to the well-pondered remarks of Mr N. P.
Howard, whose letter to me Ι have printed in the first number of the
new Journal of Philology3 and, especially in the third and fourth
books, to the communications of my friend Professor J. E. B. Mayor,
to whose notes I have appended his initials.

In the 25th and 26th volumes of the Philologus there is a long
‘J ahresbericht' by Mr Fried. Polle on the Lucretius literature after
Lachmann and Bernays3 and some remarks of his occur in Jahn's
J ahrbuecher. He hardly touches on the interpretation or philosophy
of the poet nor have I been able to adopt any of his own conjectures
which are not very numerous. The most valuable hint I have got
from him is on v 312, though my own correction is very different
from his. In several volumes of the same Philologus appear very
prolix notes on the earlier books by ΜΓ Susemihl and Mr Brieger.
The former confines himself chiefly to rearranging paragraphs and to
proposing numerous transpositions of verses, in neither Ι think with
much success. Many of his new arrangements of paragraphs are I
assert demonstrably wrong 3 and his violent transpositions would lead
to the wildest confusion. Once however I have obeyed him in not
making a new paragraph of 1v 168—175: it was an accident that
this was not done before, as my attention was absorbed in refuting
Lachmann's errors there. ΜΓ Brieger, who is the more combative
of the two, indulges mainly in conjectural alterations of the text.
Once or twice I have referred to Mr Holtze’s ‘Syntaxis Lucretianae
lineamenta.’

On the whole my criticism is now Ι believe more conservative than
it was. Again and again Ι have found that, seduced by the learning of
Lachmann, I have followed him in changes which really corrupt the
author. This must hold then in many other cases as well. If the text of
Virgil rested, like that of Lucretius, on a single manuscript, how much

there is in him we should refuse to accept as Latin! This ‘must give
