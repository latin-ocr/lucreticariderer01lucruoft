been followed by Avancius or Candidus: v1 650—652 are quite correctly
given by Avancius, and in his learned preface he says with reference
to 652 Nec coca pars cet. ‘totus prima brevi, quia quoti redditivus est '.
Crinitus l.l. xv 4 quotes 650 651 rightly, and adds ‘qua in re gramma-
ticorum nobis authoritas patrocinatur, quando et centesimus et millesi-
mus probe dicitur: partem multesimam inquit Nonius nove positum est
a Lucretio pro minima, ne quis forte paulo incautius atque audacius
a veteribus decedat. quae a me vel ob eam rationem sunt adnotata,
quoniam Marullus Bizantius aetate nostra, vir alioqui diligens, paulo
improbius delere haec et alia pro ingenio subdere tentavit 3 quae ab eius
quoque sectatoribus recepta sunt pro verissimis '. Candidus gives these
two verses rightly and says in note at end of J unt. ‘citatur N onio locus' :
he has got this clearly from Crinitus, who in the same chapter correctly
quotes and illustrates 1 (340 Qaamcle gravis cet. which the Italian mss.
and editions had corrupted: this too Candidus took from him: for Marul-
lus appears to have read Quam yravior Graios incer as does Pius in his
notes, and Gryphius of Lyons. Again vl 332 Avancius rightly gives
per rara viarum, Candidus perversely after Marullus per operta: see his
note. But fifty instances like the last might be quoted. Candidus has
also missed some of the best of Marullus' conjectures: see for instance
notes 1 to 1 1013 where I have got from the margin of one of the Floren-
tine mss. perhaps the most brilliant example of his critical acumen.
Then again unless I greatly err I have shewn in my notes that Gifam'us
in preparing his edition had before him a copy of the Venice ed. of 1495,
lent to him by the zealous scholar Sambucus, as he testifies both in his
preface to Sambucus and in his address to the reader. In the former he
says ‘exemplum Lucretii ad nos dedisti, non illum quidem calamo exa-
ratum, sed ita vetustum et idoneum, ut vicem optimi manuscripti fuerit,
siquidem in eo vidi omnium paene mendorum origines, quae magnam
partem a Michaele Marullo, cuius immutationes in eo adscriptae erant
omnes, primum parta, mox admiserunt Florentini cet.': in the address
he speaks of the ‘Sambuci liber quem ipsius Marulli manu adnotatum
magno pretio vir ille praestantissimus paravit ². Why then Lachmann
p. 6 should write ‘neque enim facile Gifanio credere possum Marulli
ipsius manu annotatum fuisse illud exemplar impressum quod se ab
Iohanne Sambuco utendum accepisse scribit ’ I cannot comprehend.
Gifanius was a dishonest plagiary‚ but at the same time a most astute
man. Why should he tell a gratuitous falsehood which sambucus would
at once detect? He was writing only two generations after Marullus’
death 5 and even if Sambucus gave his money for what was not the
handwriting of Marullus, it was at least a genuine copy of his notes.
But notes 1 furnish abundant proof of what Ι say: 366 for instance those
to 1 806 11 16 v 44 and especially 111 994. It appears then that Avan-
cius got from Marullus much which the J untine does not record, and on
