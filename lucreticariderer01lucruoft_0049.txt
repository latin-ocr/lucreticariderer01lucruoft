TO NOTES 1 33

In following Lachmann then Ι am sure that Ι have authority on my
side 3 I believe that Ι have reason as well. In those cases indeed to
which I have already referred, where the universal testimony of inscrip-
tions and of mss. beyond a certain age proves that there is only one right
way and about which the best scholars are all now agreed, there cannot
be any doubt what course should be taken: we must write querella
loquella luella sollers sollemnis sollicito Iuppiter littera quattuor stuppa
lammina ; on the other hand milia conecto comosus coniti conixus coniveo
conubium belua baca sucus litus and the like 3 condicio solacium, setius
artus (adj.) autumnus suboles: in many of them an important principle
is involved: obeying the almost unanimous testimony of our own and
other good mss. we cannot but give umerus umor and the like: also
hiemps, I have heard it asked what then is the genitive of hiemps: to
which the best reply perhaps would be what is the perfect of sumo or
supine of emo. The Latius wrote hiemps, as they wrote emplum sumpsi
sumptum and a hundred such forms, because they disliked m and s 01· l
to come together without the intervention of a p sound 3 and our mss. all
attest this: tempto likewise is the only true form, which the Italians in
the l5th century rejected for tento. Then mss. and inscriptions prove
that d took an oi before it, tandem quendam eundem and the like, with
the exception of circumdo in which the mss. both of Lucr. and Virgil
always retain the m: and generally, though not invariably, m on the
other hand remained before q : quemquam tamquam and so on, though
the new corpus inscrip. Lat. has I find nunquam} and so has Augustus
in his res gestae, but quotiescumque. Then always quicque quicquam
quicquid (indef.)‚ but generally quidquid (relative), though quicquid is
found in the lex Rubria and once in our AB : always peremo iuteremo
‘neqleqo intelleqo etc. Above all we must scout such barbarisms as coelum
moestus sylva caetera nequicquam. In these points Wagner is as good a
guide as Lachmann 3 but in regard to the cases in which ancient usage
varied shall we follow the former who deserts the mss for preconceived
general rules, or Lachmann who here also is content to obey the best
evidence he can get? Ι have unhesitatingly come over to the views of
the latter: ‘hypotheses non fingo' should be the rule in this as in other
matters As said above, all these uncertain spellings fall under a very
few general heads One of these is the assimilation or non-assimilation
of prepositions : inpero represents the etymology, impero the pronuncia-
tion of the word. From the most ancient period of which we have any
record, centuries before Cicero or Lucretius, a compromise was made be-
tween these opposing interests: words in common use soon began to
change the consonant, those in less common use retained it longer. In
the first volume of the corpus inscrip. Lat.‚ the most recent of which
are as old as the age of Lucretius, most of them much older, impe-
rator occurs 26 times, and is always spelt with m, proving that in a
