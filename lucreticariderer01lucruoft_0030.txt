I 4 INTRODUCTION

and unfounded Lachmann's procedure is in assigning everything that is
new in the J untine to Marullus ι even in the many instances where he
and Ι are in agreement, it must be remembered that 116 speaks without
authority, while I possess the testimony 01 Marullus himself]

The Juntine 010565 1116 first great epoch of improvement in the text
of Lucretius: the second Aldine edited by the well-known scholar An-
drew Naugerius and dated ‘ mense ianuario M.D.XV.’ is for the most part
a mere reprint of it without however one word of acknowledgment ac-
cording to the usage of the time. Yet the changes are not few, mostly
for the better, not always: two instances are given above from the first
page, the one a gross corruption, the other a right rejection of an inter-
polation. For the next fifty years Ald. 2 appears 10 have been the model
edition. Gryphius of Lyons published several texts, three of which
I have before me: they generally follow Naugerius, but not always,
011611 recurring to Avancius. Those 01 1534 and 1540 have many mar-
ginal readings, most of them taken from Avancius or the notes of Pius,
a few from sources not known to me: see notes 1 to 1 977 officiatque.
Yet even these two editions do not always agree with each other.

Little advance however was made on the J untine before Dionysius
Lambinus. He dates his address to Charles IX 1 November 1563 and.
afterwards speaks of his first edition as published in that year 3 though
the title-page of my copy has 1564. Lambinus was among the most
illustrious 01 1116 great Latin scholars who studied and taught at Paris
in the sixteenth century. His knowledge of Cicero and the older Latin
writers as well as the Augustan poets has never been surpassed and
rarely equalled. Whoever doubts that the nicest critical and gramma—
11061 questions can be expressed in Ciceronian Latin without effort or
afi'ectation, let him study the commentaries 01 Lambinus. Scaliger says
01 him ‘Latine et Romane loquebatur optimeque scribebat': his ease
and readiness are astonishing. He made use he tells us of five mss:
four 01 111656 appear to have been Italian mss. 01 1116 11116611111 century:
the fifth, 01 which he used a collation by Turnebus, and which he calls
the Bertinian, was the same as the Leyden quarto. In his preface and
throughout the work he acknowledges his obligations to Turnebus and
Auratus. His Lucretius is perhaps the greatest 01 1115 works: there was
more 10 106 (10116 here, and therefore he has done more. He had more-
over a peculiar admiration 101 11115 author, 01 whom in the preface to his
third edition he says ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui hodie exstant et
qui ad nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus et purissimus, idem-
que gravissimus atque ornatissimus Lucretius est'. If his boast that he
has restored the text in 800 places goes beyond the truth, though I am
not sure that it does, yet the superiority 01 1115 over all preceding texts
can scarcely be exaggerated3 101· 1116 quickness 01 1115 1111611601 united
with his exquisite knowledge of the language gave him great power in
