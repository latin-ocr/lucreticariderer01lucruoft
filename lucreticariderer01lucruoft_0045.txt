TO NOTES 1 29

and unless Ι err, I have shewn that not a few sections thus marked
by him are properly connected with what precedes and follows. Yet it
is certain that his theory applies to 11 165-183, and more than one long
paragraph of lv v and vl. It has been shewn sufficiently in the notes to
these passages that the most important of them have a close connexion
in matter and manner with each other. Like Lachmann, I have marked
them off by []. All through the poem many single verses and passages
of some length are designedly repeated by the poet, some of them again
and again. It is probable that he would have removed many of them,
if he had lived to revise his work: the exordium of 1v for instance could
hardly have been left.

Some readers may be surprised at the number of verses which have
been transposed in the poem ; but they should remember that every
ancient writing which depends finally on one ms. is in a similar plight.
When a scribe omitted by accident a verse, in order not to spoil the look
of his book, he wrote it at once after the next verse, if he immediately
discovered his error 3 if not, he omitted it altogether, or added it in
some other place, often at the bottom of a page 3 he would then affix an
a, b to mark the right order3 the next scribe would not notice or would
purposely omit these and so on : see Bentl. to Hor. ars 46. Every one
of these errors has been committed again and again by the copyists of
our poem. Most of these transpositions are certain and were made long
ago by Lambinus Marullus Avancius and others, many were first made
by Lachmann. Some of these I have not followed : not a few I have
first ventured on myself. But connected with this question Ι must draw
attention to one point which seems of importance. You would expect as
a rule single verses to be thus transposed 3 and this is the case in Lucre-
tius’ mss. as in those of other writers: sometimes too one or more verses
are repeated after the misplaced verse, which ought to follow it in its
proper place, as if to shew the reader whither it ought to be transferred:
comp. 1v 991 i.e. 999 of the mss. followed in them by 1000—1003,
which are only the vss. which follow it in its right place repeated after
it in its wrong place : see also v 570 (573) and what comes after. But
besides such usual instances of transposition there are throughout the
poem many small groups of verses, forming generally sentences complete
in themselves, which have got quite out of their right place: comp. 1 984
-987 (998-1001), 11 652-657 (655-659 680) and IV 1227 1228
(1225 1226), three passages first transposed by me, also 11 1139—1142,
1168—1170, 111 686—690, 1v 50-52, v 174 175, 1127 1128. Now
that a scribe should so often transpose several consecutive verses always
forming an entire and independent sentence by mere casual carelessness,
is to me in the highest degree improbable, Again most of these passages
read to me like possible additions not necessary to the context, though
they improve it. I believe them then to be marginal additions by the
