I 6 INTRODUCTION

fere quae in eo Lucretio recta sunt, mea sunt 3 quae tamen iste aut si-
lentio praetermittit aut maligne laudat aut sibi impudenter arrogat’,
Yet so great was the skill with which all this was done that he deceived
many and was thought to be a rival worthy of Lambinus, Contrary to
what many believe, the age loved brief notes3 and his were brief, the
other's copious. Even the great critic of that generation J oseph Scali-
ger, who well knew the character of the man and accused him of gross
deceit towards himself, says ‘ Gifanius estoit docte, son Lucrece est tres-
bon'. Lambinus however knew the truth, and his wrath was as signal
as the provocation. In 1570 he brought out a third edition greatly im-
proved and enlarged 3 much of the additional matter however consists in⁴
invectives against the aggressor. In a long preface of great power and
beauty of style he states his wrongs. There and throughout his commen-
tary the whole Latin language, rich in that department, is ransacked for
ternis of scorn and contumely. The same charges are repeated in a hun-
dred different shapes with curious copiousness and variety of expression.
Gifanius with consistent cunning attempted no public reply to all this.
Many years afterwards, when Lambinus had long been dead, a new edi·
tion of the other's book was brought out at Leyden in 1595, in which
many additions are made to the brief notes, but not a word is said of the
charges brought against him by Lambinus. He was rewarded for his
reticence, and for a century or more opinion was divided as to whether
he or Lambinus did more for Lucretius. In private he corresponded
with the cankered and unhappy Muretus: the two exchanged futile
charges of dishonesty against the dead critic, who was far too genuine
a scholar to be capable of being a plagiary. Lachmann so stern with
Avancius has nothing to say of this much more flagitious case: ‘qui quo
iure' he observes ‘aut Lambinum aut alios compilasse dictus esset non
quaesivi'. Gifanius had no business whatever to edit a poet: he was
without poetical taste and grossly ignorant of metre.

For a century after Lambinus nothing was done for Lucretius: the
common editions followed either Lambinus or Gifanius. In 1658 the
singular labours of Gassendi were given to the world. Deeply versed in
the works of the fathers and the philosophy of all ages down to the latest
discoveries of Descartes he devoted himself with the zeal of a disciple to
the dogmas of Epicurus. The two first of his huge folios are given to
this philosophy, and a large portion of them to the exposition of Lucre-
tius. Much that is curious may be gathered from them, and I have
perused them with attention 3 but to say the truth I have not found
much to my purpose in them. The author was utterly devoid of the
critical faculty, and all that is of value in him on this head is borrowed
from Lambinus; as well as the most useful of his illustrations: his cor-
rections of the text are almost without exception worthless. In the 17th
century several distinguished scholars, Salmasius J. F. Gronovius Nic.
