TO NOTES I 17

Heinsius Isaac Vossius, turned their attention to Lucretius 3 but their
labours were only desultory. Of the ms. notes by the two last which
are in my possession I will speak afterwards. In 1662 Tanaquillus
Faber or Tanneguy Lefebvre published at Saumur a text of Lucretius
followed by emendationes and notulae. He was a elever but vain man,
who seemed to think such work rather beneath him 3 he takes care how-
ever to inform his readers that he spent but little time or pains on it,
and had only Lambinus and Gifanius before him, though he owed nothing
to either. The truth is that without Lambinus he could not have ad-
vanced a step : clever man that he is, he affords a good proof how much
Latin scholarship had deteriorated in France during the century between
him anc' Eambinus, Of Parcus, Nardius, Fayus nothing need be said.

Had Bentley in 1689 or 1690 succeedcd in his efforts to obtain for
the Bodleian Isaac Vossius' famous library, he might have anticipated
what Lachmann did by a century and a half. As he was at that very
time working hard at Lucretius, if he had once got into his hands the
two mss. now at Leyden, he would at a glance have seen their import-
ance and would scarcely have failed to complete the edition which he
was then meditating. The great knowledge of Epicurus' system which
he displayed two years later in his Boyle lec-tures and his zeal for the
recently published Principia of N ewton would have aided him in ex-
pounding the tenets of the poet. This however was not to be Í¾ but his
marginal notes published in the Glasgow edition of Wakefield prove
what he could have done, if he had gone on with his design. I cannot
doubt that Lucretius would have suited him better than Horace, and
offered a fairer field for the exercise of his critical divination.

In 1695 there came from the Oxford press a Lucretius edited not by
Bentley, but by Thomas Creech Fellow of All Souls, a man of sound
sense and good taste, but to judge froin his book of somewhat arrogant
and supercilious temper. The text is nearly always a reproduction of
one or other of the editions of Lambinus: such criticism indeed he seems
in his preface to look upon as unworthy of him. His notes are in most
cases mere abridgements of those of Lambinus or copied from Faber,
and his illustrations are usually borrowed from the former. All this he
does as if it were a matter of course, not thinking it necessary either to
avow or conceal his obligations. His interpretatio is his own: how far
it is of assistance to a student must depend upon what he seeks for in
it. His Lucretius however owing to the clearness and brevity of the
notes has continued to be the popular one from that time to the present.

The worthy London bookseller Jacob Tonson published in 1712 a
finely printed text with various readings at the end collected from many
quarters with a great deal of trouble, some of value, most quite worth-
less. This I chiefly mention on account of what follows. In 1725
Sigebert Havercamp Professor at Leyden gave to the world his variorum
