34 INTRODUOTION

word, which must daily have been in everybody⁷s mouth, etymology in '
remote times yielded as was natural to sound: imperium again occurs
three, inperium six times being doubtless in somewhat less common use.
Now in Lucretius imperium impero or imperito occurs six times, and
the mss. always spell with m, and so Lucretius spelt I have no doubt:
indeed many of these common words the silver age Ι believe more
frequently wrote with η, than did that of Cicero. Then Virgil uses im-
perium 40 times 3 and Ribbeck's capital mss. have m in every instance,
except M which twice has inp, though one of these two cases is at least
doubtful: for Aen. vm 381 Fogginius prints imperiis. Yet in defiance
of all this evidence Wagner gives us inperium, surely without reason on
any view of the case 3 for the foundation on which we must build is thus
withdrawn from under our feet. To take another common instance,
commuto occurs 9 times in the corpus inscrip. and always with m 3 12 times
in Lucretius and always with m. Other words are more uncertain: we
find in the mss. impius and inpius, immortalis and inmortalis, conliqere
and colliqere, compleo and compleo 3 and 80 with other prepositions, ab, ob,
sub, ad: all tending to prove that usage was in most words uncertain.
Again we have eoesto, and emto, exsolvo, eaeulto expiro eaepecto cet„ s being
generally omitted 3 and this agrees with Quintilian 1 7 4 who implies
that it was a learned affectation of some to write exspecto in order to dis-
tinguish em and specto from em and pecto; it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. of Virgil furnish precisely the same testimony
as those of Lucretius3 yet Wagner in all such cases writes ems: surely
we should keep esc where the mss. keep it, exs where they have ems: and
so with supter or subter, suptilis or subtilis, ab· or ap-, ob- or op-, sub· or
sup , succ- or susa, and the like: appareo occurs ten times in Lucr. and
is always spelt thus by our mss. : so apparo, appello (both 1 and 3 conj.) 3
but adpetitur and always adpono, adporto or atporto, in which words the
separate force of the preposition continued to be felt: in exact conform-
ity with this the first volume of the corp. inser. has twenty times appareo
and also apparitor, proving that in the earliest times the prepOS. had
been assimilated in this common technical word: thus too in the 21 in-
stances of appareo in Virgil all Ribbeck's mss. always have app. except
M once, Aen. xl 605, misled by the usage of its age: comp. the sugges-

tive remark of Servius to Aen. Ι 616 ‘applicat: secundum praesentem ⁴

usum per d prima syllaba scribitur ε secundum antiquam orthographiam
...per p' : yet in defiance of all this Wagner makes Virgil always write
adpareo and the like. We find haud and haut, and sometimes aliut ali-
quit quicquit and the like, sound and etymology carrying on an undecided
battle in the mss. of Lucretius, as in inscriptions and elsewhere: adque
is sometimes but rarely found, sound having here as might be expected
gained the victory: Wagner cannot be right in always forcing adque on
Virgil. Lucretius seems to have recognised only sed : he once has εῐαόεα,
