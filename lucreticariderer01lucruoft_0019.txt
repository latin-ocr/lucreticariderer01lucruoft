He had already tried in vain what coaxing could do: he promises him
at one time to send the book back in fifteen days⁷ at another time in one
month, if he will only let him have it for so long 3 but feels sure his
book will come to him at the Greek calends. Much as Niccoli loved
Poggio, he loved still more to have the sole possession of a newly dis-
covered Latin poet, and I doubt whether Poggio saw his Lucretius at all
events before his return from Rome to Florence in 1434. N iccoli died
in 14:37 and left behind him a manuscript written by his own hand and
now in the Laurentian library, the truest representative of Poggio's lost
original, as is abundantly proved by the critical notes of the present
edition. Between this date and that of the earliest printed editions a
knowledge of the poem was diffused through Italy by many incorrect
copies. Eight of these, including Niccoli's, are preserved in the Lauren-
tian library, all of which I have examined, two with care, as being of no
small importance for the text3 six are in the Vatican, all seen by me as
long ago as the autumn of 1849. Of the copies in England I have had
in my hands at least seven 3 one of these belonging to our Cambridge
library has been open before me the whole time I was writing my criti-
cal noteS. Those manuscripts which have been of any importance in
forming the text will be more fully spoken of, after the printed editions
have been discussed.

The editio princeps, of which only three copies are known, was
printed about 1473 by F erandus of Brescia. It is the only one of the
early editions which I do not possess 3 I have had to trust therefore to
the very unskilful collation of Gerard at the end of the Glasgow edition
of Wakefield. As it was printed from a manuscript a good deal cor-
rected, but yet inferior to such amended copies as the Cambridge ms. for
instance or that which I call F lor. 31, it is of little importance in the
history of the text: of far less than the two next editions, since they by
accident came to be the foundation of the vulgate. The former of these
was published by Paulus Fridenperger at Verona in 1486 ‘die vigesimo
octavo septembris calen. octobris'. It was printed from a ms. closely re-
sembling the one written by Niccoli‚ as may be seen by the most cursory
inspection of my critical notes. It is therefore very rude and inaccumte,
but being less interpolated than the editio princeps or the majority of
existing mss. it represents the archetype more faithfully than these do,
though there is hardly a line without some monstrous blunder. The
next edition was published in Venice ‘per theodorum de ragazonibus de
asula dictum bresanum ⁷ 4 september 1495. From some elegiac verses at
the end one O. Lycinius would appear to be its editor, if editor he can
be called3 for it exactly reproduces for the most part the Verona edition
even in the minutest points of its perverse punctuation. There are how-
ever throughout the poem not a few differences in the two editions, some
