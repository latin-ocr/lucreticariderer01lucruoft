Ι 57

sunt igitur solida primordia simplicitate

nec ratione queunt alia servata per aevom

ex infinito iam tempore res reparare. 550
Denique si nullam finem natura parasset

frangendis rebus, iam corpora materiai

usque redacta forent aevo frangente priore,

ut nil ex illis a certo tempore posset

conceptum summum aetatis pervadere ad anctum. 555

nam quidvis citius (liswlvi posse videmus

qilam rursus reficig quapropter longa diei

infinita aetas anteacti temporis omnis

quod fregisset adhuc disturbans dissoluensque,

numquam relicuo reparari tempore posset. 560

at nunc nimirum frangendi reddita finis

certa manet, quoniam refici rem quamque videmus

et finita simul generatim tempora rebus

stare, quibus possint aevi contingere florem.

huc accedit uti, solidissima materiai 565

corpora cum constant, possit tamen, omnia, reddi,

551—627: Junt. puts 577—583 aster 627, and 551—564 after 583. At the end
of his edition Candidus says ‘Marulli nos hoc loco ordinem, atque item alibi in
plerisque, ubi immutatum quid offenderis, secutos esse '·‚ and so Marullus himself
in the eod. Victor.: buthe appears from Flor. 30 to have got the suggestion from
Niccoli himself. The learned annotator of Flor. 32 says in the margin to 550
that some put 551—564 after 576, and adds ‘ verum Marullo parum referre videtur
quomodo legatur ’, shewing again that there were different traditions about Marullus.
Lamb. places only 577—583 after 627. All these transpositions are utterly wrong,
though Candidus says of Marullus ‘quem profecto, si ad amussim rem quanque
examinabis, neutiquam (sic opinor) repudiaveris '. Sauppe, Christ and others
likewise transpose in various ways these much-tortured vss: the misapprehension
of 599-634 is at the bottom of such causeless changes. 553 forent B corr.
Nice. for fovent. 555 ad anctum Ed. These words came at the end of page 23
of the archetype from which all mss. are derived, and therefore were at the outside
margin and, as has happened in so many cases, were torn away by some accident.
Some one then filled up the verse with finis which occurs three times at the end of
a line in the next thirty verses. Lach. keeps finis and for summum reads summa
which he thus awkwardly explains, ‘summa, hoe est universo vivendi actu, aetatis
pervadere fines, per omne vitae spatium vadere ³. summum...florem Mar. Junt. Lamb.
ed. 1 and 2, Creech etc. which Lach. proves could only mean ‘pass through' not
‘ arrive at the fiower '. summum...finem Flor. 30 corr. Ver. Ven. Lamb. ed. 3, Wak.
etc. This is doubly wrong, as finis in Lucretius is always feminine. 562
quamque videmus B corr. Nice. for quamque demus. 566 possit Ed. for possint,
a corruption which constant and omnia almost inevitably caused. [Sauppe I am
