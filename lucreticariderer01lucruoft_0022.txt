follows Avancius in the minutest points of spelling and punctuation.
The latter for instance says in his preface that he writes ‘veteres
imitatus repertumst, itemst, necessest' and the like : Candidus in his
preface that ‘in tam culto, tam nitido, tam undecunque castigato poeta'
he will not admit archaisms like volymn, volnera3 or nullast, haudqua-
quamst and the like. And so in his text while rejecting Avancius’
patefactast, volnere, etc„ he keeps his fruqffereozteis‚ rapacez's and a
thousand such forms which have no authority in their favour, while
those which he discards have much. Lachmann always so hard upon
Avancius says ‘huius ineptissimam scribendi rationem Eichstadius
studiose imitatus est’, but has not a word of blame for Candidus.

But whence has the latter got his many and brilliant corrections?
for few or none appear to come from himself. He says in his address
to Thomas Sotherinus that what he did was to collate all the vetusta
eoeemplctria that were in Florence and to expunge what was condemned
by the obeli of Pontanus and Marullus, ‘praestantissimorum aetate
nostra vatum'. He refers of course to John Iovianus Pontanus and his
friend and pupil Michael Marullus, after Politian two of the first
scholars and Latin poets of the most flourishing period of Florentine
learning, the latter half of the fifteenth century ε ‘ Marullo ed 11 Pontan'
have the honour to be mentioned together by Ariosto in the Orlando
XXXVII 8. But Candidus goes on afterwards to speak only of Marullus
‘cuius in hoc opere censuram potissimum secuti sumus ' 3 and in a note
at the end he says that in changing the order of verses here andin most
other places he has followed the arrangement of Marullus. To Marullus
therefore everything which is peculiar to the Juntine has usually been
assigned, whether in the way of praise, or of blame as by Victorius
and by J oseph Scaliger who inherited among many other of his father's
antipathies his dislike to Marullus. But Lachmann has gone much
farther than this, and has given to him not only by oversight, as will be
seen in notes 1, much that belongs to older authorities 3 but everything
that first appeared 111 Avancius' edition as well, calling the latter ‘fur
improbus’ and other opprobrious names. That he got much assistance
from the labours of Marullus is certain3 but by ascribing to the latter
everything that is in the Juntine, in some respects more, in others less
credit is given to him than he deserves. As I can throw some light on
this interesting question, I will examine it at some length here and in
various parts of notes 1.

The scholar, poet and soldier, Michael Tarchaniota Marullus Con-
stantinopolitanus‚ as he calls himself in the editions of his poems
printed during his life, appears from this title and his epitaph in San
Domenico of Ancona, where he and so many of his ancestors are buried,
as well as from the epithet Bizantius given to him by his friend Petrus
Crinitus, to have been born in Constantinople. As he can hardly
