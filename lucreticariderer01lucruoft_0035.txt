stances of his age could not himself furnish them3 nay in one case he
has given Lambinus' own words as those of Cicero. In his two bulky
volumes there is not one week's genuine work beyond what scissors and
paste could do: seldom has performance fallen so far short of profession
and opportunity.

There is nothing to detain us between Havercamp and Wakefield
who in 1796 and 1797 gave his three volumes to the world, rivalling
the other's in magnitude. Yet the work, such as it is, is his own, and
is not a mere slothful compilation from others. Gilbert Wakefield pos-
sessed one quality which a critic can ill dispense with, that of despising
any amount of authority which did not rest on some real foundation,
and refusing to admit that, because a reading had appeared in edition
after edition for centuries, it might by that alone claim recognition. He
therefore set about a new revision which was to be based on manuscript
authority alone3 but neither his knowledge nor his industry nor his
ability nor his taste sufficed for such a work. He professed to collate
five English mss, among them our Cambridge one, and most of the old
editions. This task he executed with incredible carelessness, As he had
the full use of the Cambridge ms.‚ one might have expected that his
collation of it would be done with some care3 but it is quite untrust-
worthy. From this as well as the evidence of his own notes and the
nature of the case Ι infer that his other collations are not more to
be depended upon. Had this labour been faithfully performed, it would
still have been of little use, as he had no notion of the true relation
of these late mss to one another. He looked on each as an inde-
pendent authority and thought he could not do wrong, if the words he
put in his text were found in one or other of them. Then he had to
take from Havercamp the readings of the Leyden mss„ and therefore
could gain no true insight into their character. As he had no know-
ledge of the language or philosophy of his author, he undertook to
explain whatever words he put into his text in long turgid notes of
unmeaning verbiage. His work was got through with a strange precipi-
tancy : when engaged on the first part, he had never read the other parts
of the poem ; when he came to them, he had forgotten what went before.
Morbidly vain and utterly unconscious of the immeasureable distance
between Lambinus and himself, he assails the most brilliant and certain
emendations of the unrivalled scholar in a hideous jargon and with a
vehemence of abuse that would be too great even for his own errors.
Thus by some fatality or other, by its falling into the hands of a Gifanius
Havercamp Wakefield instead of those of a Salmasius Gronovius Hein-
sius Bentley, the criticism of Lucretius remained for centuries where it
had been left by Lambinus, nay even retrograded. And yet Wakefield
did display occasional flashes of native genius, and our notes will shew
that not a few certain corrections are due to him 3 but from the first to
