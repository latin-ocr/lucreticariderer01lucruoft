8 INTRODUCTION

inserts two new verses in the poem ‘de poetis Latinis ' spoken of above,
Natura mayni versibus Lucretii Lepore musaeo illicis, the best in the
poem and recalling musaeo continqens cuncta lepore. Crinitus 1.1. XXIII
7 quotes this poem and mentions a conversation he had with Marullus
in which ‘factum est iudicium nuper a nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis
egregie perfectum et prudenter ⁸, and Ovid and other poets are blamed 3
and then it is added ‘itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes inquit [Marul-
lus] 3 sed hi maxime probandi pro suo quisque genere Tibullus Horatius
Catullus et in comoedia Terentius. Vergilium vero et Lucretium edis-
cendas asserebat '. Let what has just been said be at once applied to a
striking interpolation. After I 15 the Juntine first inserted the v.
I Hecebrisque tuis omnis natura animantum, which long kept its place in
the common editions, Lachmann of course attributes it to Marullus, as
do most editors. Lambinus says of it ‘neque eum Naugerius neque
Pontanus habuerunt. Marullus unus vir doctus ex auctoritate veteris
cuiusdam codicis, quemadmodum mihi religiose asseveravit Donatus
Ianottus, nobis eum restituit. amicus quidam meus ingenio et doctrina
praestantissimus putat esse ab ipso Marullo factum cet.' What his
authority is for that which he says of Pontanus I do not know, but Nau-
gerius editor of the Aldine of 1515 properly omits the line, though he
in genera] minutely copies the Juntine. Now this line is written by the
hand of Angelo Politian in the margin of a manuscript which belonged
to him and forms xxxv 29 of the Laurentian library. Politian died in
September 1494, when Marullus could hardly yet have done much for
Lucretius 3 and besides this as he had been long the deadly enemy of
Politian, it is not likely the latter would have inserted in his manuscript
one of his verses. I infer therefore that it is Politian's own 3 and as
Candidus says in his preface that he collated all the ‘ vetusta exemplaria’
in Florence‚ he could not have neglected this manuscript which was
then in the famous conventual library of San Marco. I conclude therefore
that Candidus' taking it from the margin of Politian's ms, is the right
explanation of Ianottus’ assertion that Marullus got it from an ancient
codex. It is quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it himself from
this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately after Politian's decease,
and thus robbed him of his verse after death, as he is said to have
robbed him of his bride during life. Naugerius has in his first page
another variation from the Juntine, but that a perverse one: in I 7 he
reads Adventuque tuo and joins it with what follows. This corruption
I believe to proceed from Marullus 3 for his hymn to the sun contains a
passage evidently imitated from Lucretius: Cum primum tepidi sub
tempora verna favoni Aura suum terris yenitalem exuscitat auctum:
Adventuque dei yem mantia prata colorat: At pecudum yenus omne νέφει,
glenus omne virorum Perculsi teneras anni dulcedine mentes. I can
shew in other cases that Marullus corrupted Lucretius, where he has not
